# dwc2-for-klipper
A translator between DWC2 and Klipper

# !!! CAUTION !!!
Its an early stage, horrible things can happen to you, your printer, your moms cellar or your cat.
For first trys its a good idea to limit printer speed in config to a low value like 25mm/s or 50mm/s.
If a ${disastercondition of doom} is occouring, you can hit the emergency button. The emergency button shuts
down immediately no gcode queue or similar in between, it just overrides everything.

## What works

* printing from klippers virtual sdcard
* pause / cancel prints (resume?)
* babystepping feature using klippers ```SET_GCODE_OFFSET Z_ADJUST```
* editing klippers configuration. Its displayed as config.g in system section. So the webif restarts klipper after saving.
* Klipper macros are imported as virtual files and can be accesed from the dashboard
* uploads and downloads of gcodes
* gcode analysis using regex to determine duration / layerhighth / firstlayer / filamentusage and other
* the math for printtime left based on whatever, showing layerhistory, detecting layerchanges etc. (needs working slicer regex)
* settings of webinterface are saved and loded correctly
* homing / extruding / moving
* heater control
* setting fanspeed / extrusionmultipler / speedfactor during print in statuswindow
* Heightmap is working. (needs manual ```BED_MESH_CALIBATE```) It is kept only for displaying, even after ```BED_MESH_CLEAR```

## What is not working

* webcam integration
* ~~heightmap~~
* printsimulation
* actual machinespeed, only displaying the requested values
  * klipper does not have this feedback (yet)? due to its lookahead feature 
  * can we calc this? movelength/junction/acceleration is there
* ......

## Things you should know

* Klipper messages are marked as warnings.
 * Noramly klipper knows ok and error
* Klippers printer.cfg is displayed as a virtual file (cinfig.g) in System section
 * restart after conf edits works
* The macros you define in printer.cfg are displayed as virtal files wthin DWCs macros
* ....

## Installation

### Prerequirements
python2, tornado, gunzip, unzip, wget

##### On arch:
```
sudo pacman -Sy && pacman -S python2 python2-tornado wget gunzip
```

Maybe youÂ´ll need to change the startup system for klipper to access ~/klipper/klippy/klippy.py

##### On Octopi / Ubuntu / Debian (untested, feedback wanted)
I asume here that you used the octopi install script from Kevins github.
```
sudo apt install wget gunzip tar
```

Then switch to your klipper user and:
```
sudo systemctl stop klipper
cd ~
PYTHONDIR="${HOME}/klippy-env"
virtualenv ${PYTHONDIR}
${PYTHONDIR}/bin/pip install tornado==5.1.1

git clone https://github.com/Stephan3/klipper.git
git clone https://github.com/Stephan3/dwc2-for-klipper.git
ln -s ~/dwc2-for-klipper/web_dwc2.py ~/klipper/klippy/extras/web_dwc2.py

mkdir -p ~/sdcard/dwc2/web
cd ~/sdcard/dwc2/web 
wget https://github.com/chrishamm/DuetWebControl/releases/download/2.0.0-RC3/DuetWebControl.zip
unzip *.zip && for f_ in $(find . | grep '.gz');do gunzip ${f_};done
sudo systemctl start klipper
```

##### if you want backwards compatibility to dwc 1:
```
cd ~/sdcard/dwc2/web 
wget https://github.com/chrishamm/DuetWebControl/releases/download/1.22.5/DuetWebControl-1.22.5.zip
unzip DuetWebControl-1.22.5.zip
for f_ in $(find . | grep '.gz');do gunzip ${f_};done
```

### Klipper config example:
```
[virtual_sdcard]
path: /home/pi/sdcard

[web_dwc2]
# optional - defaulting to Klipper
printer_name: Reiner Calmund
# optional - defaulting to 0.0.0.0
listen_adress: 0.0.0.0
# needed - use above 1024 as nonroot
listen_port: 4750
#	optional defaulting to dwc2/web. Its a folder relative to your virtual sdcard.
web_path: dwc2/web
```

## Fix missing stuff in klipper today
A Gcode callback and ack system is missing in klippy today for other objects than the serial. You need to use my klipper fork or patch the few lines by hand in gcode.py.
See https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/pull/1290
